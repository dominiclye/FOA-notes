- The binary number system is a base 2 number system which means that each possible value can be represented by two symbols.
- In computing, this often translates into 1s and 0s, boolean values, or off and on. All carrying the same effect.
- Converting binary to base 10 is the same process as [[Hexadecimal]]. Take the right-most character, multiply it by it's positional power of 2, and sum the product of each character. 
  **Example with 1001**
  1 * 2^0 = 1
  0 * 2^1 = 0
  0 * 2^2 = 0
  1 * 2^3 = 8
  The sum of all products is 9, therefore, 1001 (binary) = 9 (base 10)
