- C is statically typed language, meaning that the code is compiled at runtime and therefore all variable types must be specified when declared
- Memory is managed in the code as there is no garbage collector.
	- Variables are stored at an address in the memory.
	- Addresses can be stored in memory too, an address which points to another address is called a pointer.
